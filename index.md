### What is the most interesting topic covered in your domain this quarter?
I will say that how distribution functions are implemented in R — all of them are implemented with uniform distribution.

### Describe a potential investigation you would like to pursue for your Quarter 2 Project.
I am interested to see if advanced DSC students will be able to better understand probability if we teach them with code. I will keep track of their progress.
