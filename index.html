<h3>What is the most interesting topic covered in your domain this quarter?</h3>
<p>I will say that how distribution functions are implemented in R — all of them are implemented with uniform distribution.</p>

<h3>Describe a potential investigation you would like to pursue for your Quarter 2 Project.</h3>
<p>I am interested to see if advanced DSC students will be able to better understand probability if we teach them with code. I will keep track of their progress.</p>
